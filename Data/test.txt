Reading is one of the most valuable skills a person can develop. It opens the door to knowledge, imagination, and personal growth. Unlike other forms of entertainment, reading engages the mind, encourages critical thinking, and allows people to explore ideas beyond their own experiences. Whether through books, articles, or online resources, reading is a key tool for lifelong learning.
