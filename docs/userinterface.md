# Homework 2 - User Interface
## About
Your assignment is to create a command-line utility that will allow agents to view file contents.

Create the command line interface used by the user to run the program.

When the program runs with a number as an argument, the contents of the corresponding file is displayed on screen. 

When the program runs with no arguments, it should list the numbered files available to display. E.g.:

01 filea.txt

02 fileb.txt

03 filec.txt

In the absence of a second parameter, the program uses the default key for deciphering. However, a second parameter can be supplied that specifies an alternate key to use when deciphering.

The program exits after showing the file list, the contents of an indicated file, or after displaying an error message.
