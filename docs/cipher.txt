Cipher Purpose:
The Cipher component is responsible for reading a cipher key file, validating it, and
providing functionality to decipher encrypted text.
It ensures that the key file follows required formatting rules before allowing decipher operations.

Cipher default key is key.txt and is stored in the ciphers folder

Requirements for custom file:
File must contain exactly two lines-
Line 1: Original characters
Line 2: Corresponding cipher characters

*Characters can not be repeated

Validation:
The file must exist.
The file must contain exactly two lines.
Both lines must be the same length.
No duplicate characters are allowed in the original line or cipher line.


decipher method:
Accepts a ciphered String and returns the corresponding deciphered version

tests:
Test valid cipher file
Test file does not exist
Test missing first line
Test missing second line
Test more than two lines
Test different length lines
Test duplicate characters in original line
Test duplicate characters in cipher line
Test decipher normal mapping
Test decipher with unmapped characters
Test decipher empty string
