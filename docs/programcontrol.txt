Test file does not exist
Test missing first line
Test missing second line

ProgramControl documentation

runProgram():
checks if the first argument is invalid (empty or too large), gives error if so
checks if second argument exists or not
if the first argument isn't valid, print all the files in Data
if the second argument doesn't exist, call Cipher with the default key
if the second argument is good, call Cipher with the custom key (filepath)
