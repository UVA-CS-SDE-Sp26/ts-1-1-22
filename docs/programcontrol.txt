Test Documentation



User Interface:
No args: should start with "No file selected" and have two lines
First argument non-number: Should have an error
3+ arguments: should give error

File Handler:
setUp() - Initializes a File Handler Object

getFileNames() - Verifies that the first discovered file in the Data directory
is stored and returned correctly.

getFileContent() - Verifies that the contents of the first file
in the Data directory are read, parsed, and returned correctly.

Test getContentsSize() - Verifies that the correct number
of file contents are stored after reading all files.


Program Control:
Test no arguments -> should give list of files
Test 1 argument -> should run the file handler with default cipher
Test 2 arguments -> should use second argument as cipher
Test 3+ arguments -> should give an error


Cipher:
Test valid cipher file
Test file does not exist
Test missing first line
Test missing second line
Test more than two lines
Test different length lines
Test duplicate characters in original line
Test duplicate characters in cipher line
Test decipher normal mapping
Test decipher with unmapped characters
Test decipher empty string



ProgramControl documentation

runProgram():
checks if the first argument is invalid (empty or too large), gives error if so
checks if second argument exists or not
if the first argument isn't valid, print all the files in Data
if the second argument doesn't exist, call Cipher with the default key
if the second argument is good, call Cipher with the custom key (filepath)
