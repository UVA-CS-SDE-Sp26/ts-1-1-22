File Handler Purpose:

    This module will contain the File Handler object
    which works when this object is called and taking
    a argument "data directory". By default it will take
    the parameter and call its private function, putFileInArray,
    which takes the directory name and create a file object in
    order to store those names. Then proceeding the file type
    array it will put each element inside the parser.contents
    array list storing the string value. Immediately after it
    will call readAndParseFiles which will for the size of the
    ArrayList and it will call a local string builder and
    continuously add lines of each .txt file and concatenate it
    in the StringBuilder object. Once it reaches the end of a .txt
    file it will add it to the contents. Contents will be sorted
    in order in which ever order it is in the Data folder.

Components:

    File Handler Has two main components in order to store
    and read data inside the Data Folder. putFilesInArray will
    directly look into the Data folder and only grab the names
    of the .txt files and store them in an array. The order of which
    it is stored in the array will be dependent on the order which
    it is in the Data folder. The next functions called is the
    readAndParseFiles; this function will index through the fileNames
    array list and for each file read its contents and put it in
    another global array called fileContents and is ordered the same
    way it was in fileNames;

== FileHandler ==

 + FileHandler
 + getContentSize
 + getFileNames
    - args: int indexNum
 + getFileContent
    - args: int indexNum

 - readAndParseFiles
 - putFilesInArray
    - args: File fileDirectory, Path basePath

Validations:

    Folder Data must exist and at least contain one .txt file or
    it will return NULL values.

Tests:

    getFileNames - test valid file name according to the corresponding index
    getFileContent - test valid file content according to the corresponding index
    getContentSize - test valid number of contents. should be equal to the getFileNames()
